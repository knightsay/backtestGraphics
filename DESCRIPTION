Type: Package
Title: Interactive Graphics for Portfolio Data
Description: Creates an interactive graphics 
             interface to visualize backtest results of different financial 
             instruments, such as equities, futures, and credit default swaps.
             The package does not run backtests on the given data set but 
             displays a graphical explanation of the backtest results. Users can
             look at backtest graphics for different instruments, investment 
             strategies, and portfolios. Summary statistics of different 
             portfolio holdings are shown in the left panel, and interactive 
             plots of profit and loss (P&L), net market value (NMV) and 
             gross market value (GMV) are displayed in the right panel.
