\details{
The backtestGraphics package creates an interactive graphics interface for
commodity futures portfolios, equity portfolios and credit default swap. The
interface contains three drop-down menus that allow the user to look at
different portfolios, different investment strategies and different sectors
or commodities. Summary statistics of the start date, end date, allocated
capital, average GMV, number of instruments, cumulative P&L, annualized P&L,
annualized volatility, sharpe ratio, best month and worst month are displayed
in the summary screen. More details of the top three drawdowns, three best
performers and three worst performers are displayed in another detail screen.
An interactive plot for the cumulative P&L or the daily P&L is shown at the
top and another interactive graph for nmv, gmv and number of contracts is
displayed at the bottom.

The package contains a main function \code{backtestGraphics} that takes in a
data frame of backtest results, and returns summary statistics about the data
frame and plots the historical traces of market values and profits. The package
also contains many helper functions that perform the calculations and
plotting for the \code{backtestGraphics} function. These helper functions can
only be called within the \code{backtestGraphics} function.

The package contains three data frames, \code{commodity}, \code{equity} and
\code{credit}. The \code{commodity} data frame contains the backtest results
for 28 commodities in the futures market. The \code{equity} data frame
contains the backtest results for random 50 stocks. The \code{credit} data
frame is the backtest result for credit default swap. The user can simply
call \code{backtestGraphics} with these data frames. An example will be
\code{backtestGraphics(x = commodity)}.

In order to use the user's own data frame, sometimes the user might need to
specify the column names of her data frame and pass them into the function.
Type \code{?backtestGraphics} for more details.
