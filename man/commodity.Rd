\description{

2003-01-01 to 2005-12-30. The data frame contains daily positions and profits
for each commodity.
}
\details{
The commodity data frame contains three layers of complexity. The first layer
is the strategy layer. The \code{strategy} column contains three different
strategies that divide the whole data frame into three part. Each strategy is
further divided into different substrategies, and all these substrategies are
contained in the \code{substrategy} column. For each substrategy, different
portfolios are formed regularly and overlapping with each other, so each
substrategy is divided into different overlapping portfolios, contained in
the \code{portfolio} column.
